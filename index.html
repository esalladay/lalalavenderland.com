			<p>Our vision is to spread lavender love throughout the land to bring about healthier, healing communities. We grow lavender to make supplemental healing products for the people we loveâ€”our customers.</p>
			<p>La La Lavenderland is a lavender farm found on more than 10 acres of sandy farmland located in north Spokane county Washington. Lavender antiseptic qualities can help certain skin conditions and reduce inflammation. 
			It also helps relieve muscle aches and pains, and can even remedy headaches.With our unique blend of lavender and herbs, we create salves, lip balms, bath salts, sachets, bouquets, wreaths, and next year we will be adding 
			hydrosols and more! Gifts from our garden are hand made and fashioned in the cottage craft tradition.
